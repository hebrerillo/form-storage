# A utility to save/retrieve information of forms in/from storage.

Here is a live example: https://hebrerillo.github.io/form-storage/

You can fill in the input fields, reload the browser, and all the previous information is retrieved.

It is especially useful for long forms as it will prevent the user from filling all the information again after an unexpected page reload.

The utility is written in TypeScript and tested with Jest.
