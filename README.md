# A TypeScript utility to save and retrieve form in storage

This utility saves on storage information input on a form by users.

Let's imagine a use case. A user is using their mobile phone and filling a form with many different inputs. Then the user receives a call that takes a lot of time. Once the call is done, the user goes back to the browser to continue the form filling, the browser automatically reloads and all the previous input information is lost.

With this utility, all the previous information entered is retrieved and filled again in the form. So the user can continue filling the form from the point before the call.

Here is a live example: https://hebrerillo.github.io/form-storage/

You can fill in the input fields, reload the browser, and all the previous information is retrieved.
